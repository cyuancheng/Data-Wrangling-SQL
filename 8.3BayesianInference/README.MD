For this final mini-project, you’ll return to the hospital dataset you’ve worked with in the previous subunits to practice applying what you’ve learned about Bayesian inference. As with the last mini-projects, we’ve included some additional tips and information to help you better understand this approach to inference.
Again, if you find that your versions of numpy become incompatible after installing PyMC3, this package-list.txt file should help you install a conda environment with compatible versions.
